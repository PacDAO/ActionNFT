The rare auction contract was deployed to [0xd56c12efd06252f1f0098a8fe517da286245c0a8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd56c12efd06252f1f0098a8fe517da286245c0a8), allowing the top five bidders to receive the rare version of the NFT, with all else able to claim a refund after the resolution.

The common version was deployed to to [0xe60a7825a80509de847ffe30ce2936dfc770db6b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe60a7825a80509de847ffe30ce2936dfc770db6b),
 issued with a cap of 3000 and a linear price ramp of .001 after each mint from a .005 floor price.
 
The Action is targeting the infrastructure bill, which contained irrelevant and damaging language about cryptocurrency.  The scored action is any politician who brings to floor vote an amendment to remove this language.  The conclusion is determined by the PAC DAO.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
